#Completely forgot to put this here after I finished it. Also making some progress on the GUI.
#Everything here is subject to change, and once we have more of the code down I'll work on more detailed blurbs and their respective responses

# BAD CHOICES
# BAD STORY PATH- YOU ARE AN ASSASSIN TRAVELING TO KILL A BENEVOLENT NOBLE AND SUCH
# THERE IS A POOR MAN STRUGGLING WITH HIS BAGS ON THE ROAD- HELP HIM/ IGNORE HIM/ ROB HIM
# YOU STUMBLE ACROSS AN OCCULT TEXT NEAR A WELL-KNOWN TOMB- BURN IT/ LEAVE IT BE/ TAKE IT FOR YOURSELF
# YOU SPOT A CRIMINAL FROM A WANTED POSTER YOU SAW IN TOWN- ARREST HIM/ IGNORE HIM/ KILL AND ROB HIM
# ON YOUR TRAVELS, YOU STUMBLE UPON A DERELICT FORTRESS- EXPLORE IT, BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DESTROY ANYTHING/ JUST WALK PAST/ PILFER AND PILLAGE!
# IN <<THE TOWN YOU'RE STAYING AT>>, BANDITS EMERGE AND START THREATENING THE VILLAGERS- FIGHT THEM OFF/ BARGAIN WITH THEM/ JOIN THEM IN TERRORIZING THE VILLAGERS
# THERE IS AN UNATTENDED HORSE TIED TO A FENCEPOST ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD- GIVE IT A GOOD PET/ IGNORE IT/ STEAL IT
# WHILE MAKING YOUR WAY THROUGH TOWN, YOU DISCOVER A LOST COIN BAG- FIND ITS OWNER AND RETURN IT/ JUST LEAVE IT BE, ITS NOT YOUR PLACE TO RETURN LOST GOODS/ TAKE IT, AND KEEP THE GOLD FOR YOURSELF
# AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH THE MARKETS, YOU DECIDE TO BUY SOME SUPPLIES, BUT YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE BEING OVERCHARGED BY THE MERCHANT- JUST BUY THE SUPPLIES ANYWAYS/ HAGGLE FOR A BIT/ THREATEN HIM WITH VIOLENCE
# AT A LOCAL TAVERN, YOU COME ACROSS A FEW YOUTHS VANDALIZING THE BUILDING- CHASTIZE THEM, JUST KEEP WALKING/ HELP THEM VANDALIZE THE TAVERN
# YOU SPOT YOUR TARGET- CONFRONT HIM AND ASK TO JOIN HIS RANKS / SPARE HIM AND LEAVE / KILL HIM. NO MERCY.
